 **Project Description: Airline Passenger Satisfaction Web App**
This project involves building an interactive web application using Streamlit to analyze airline passenger satisfaction data. The app aims to provide users with insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Factor Analysis. Furthermore, it implements predictive modeling using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms to classify passengers based on their satisfaction levels.

**Key Features:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Visualize data distribution, correlations, and relationships between features.
Display key statistics and insights that highlight patterns affecting passenger satisfaction.
Dimensionality Reduction:

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
Reduce the dataset's dimensionality and visualize the most important components.

**Factor Analysis:** 
Identify underlying factors influencing passenger satisfaction.

**Predictive Modeling:**
Implement Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
Compare model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) to evaluate prediction effectiveness.

**Interactive Interface:**
Allow users to interact with the data, choose features for analysis, and visualize model outcomes.

Display graphical representations of EDA, PCA, and model predictions for better understanding.
This web app is designed to be user-friendly, providing both data analysts and business users with tools to make data-driven decisions regarding airline passenger satisfaction.
